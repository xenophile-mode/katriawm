Using bars with katriawm
========================

In the repo, you can find `src/barinfo` which contains a tool to monitor
and evaluate the root window property `_KATRIA_STATE`. This property
contains some of katriawm’s internal state. See also
[`DOCUMENTATION.md`][katriadoc].

I, myself, use [bevelbar] which I wrote shortly after writing katriawm
itself. Initially, the barinfo tool also contained code to create output
for [lemonbar], but this has been removed after version v16.12 since it
was unmaintained.

In fact, I do use two instances of bevelbar: One shows `_KATRIA_STATE`,
the other is a generic info bar. I’ll only talk about the first one
here.

Note that you can configure katriawm’s workarea offsets in your
`config.h` to make room for the bar.

Please also note that there is no need to use [bevelbar]. These are just
examples. However, bevelbar’s visual style fits best with katriawm’s
default theme.

Running
-------

I suggest you run it like this:

    while sleep 1; do katriabi; done |
    while sleep 1; do bevelbar ...; done

This way, you can put this in your `~/.xinitrc` and simply issue a
`killall katriabi` if you make changes to the binary.

Plus, bevelbar does not handle XRandR changes. This can be easily worked
around by restarting the bar. Thus, after doing `xrandr --output ...`,
you have to do a `killall bevelbar`. A loop like the one above ensures
that the bar will be restarted automatically and continues to read
status information.


Configuration
-------------

katriabi is configured by means of a `config.h` file. A default file
`config.def.h` is provided. It should be pretty self-explanatory, the
main purpose is to define “symbols” for layout algorithms and optional
names for workspaces:

    char *layout_names[LALast] = {
        [LATile] = "[]=",
        ...
    };

    char *ws_names[WORKSPACE_MAX + 1] = {
        [1] = "www",
        [7] = "irc",
        ...
    };

This means that workspace `1` will be displayed as `1:www` and workspace
`7` as `7:irc`. All other workspaces are unaffected.
