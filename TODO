TODO items and future ideas.

- Simplify "gap" and "margin" code
    - There already is manage_apply_gaps() and almost nothing has to
      deal with gaps directly. Can we get rid of manual usage of
      "gap_pixels" entirely?
    - There should be a function similar to manage_apply_gaps() that
      deals with the margin reserved for window decorations. Nothing
      should have to deal with "m_left" and friends manually.
    - Maybe rethink the idea of c->x and friends being the *internal*
      size?
- Test on different architectures
- More IPC calls:
    - Jump to workspace N on monitor M?
    - Wipe all save slots?
    - Move all clients to selected monitor (keeping their workspaces).
- EWMH:
    - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and _NET_CLIENT_LIST if there's a really good
      reason to support them.
- Theming:
    - Allow for different layout (dec_coords and maybe dgeo) depending
      on window state.
- Very unlikely to happen: katriarc, a client for supplying runtime
  configuration. Would have to work the way herbstclient does (creating
  a window). Would free you from the need to recompile and reexec
  katriawm. Adds a lot of complexity, though.
